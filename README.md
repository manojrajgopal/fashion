# üöÄ How to Run This Project

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd ai-powered-personal-stylish-and-outfit-recommendation/

2. Prepare the datasets and models:
    You have two options:
        Download the pre-trained models and datasets.
        Train the models yourself.
    The following directories contain the necessary components:
    - age_gender-dataset/
    - fashion_recommend/    
    - fashion-dataset/
    - image_based/
    - occasion/
    - weather_based/
    üìÑ Each folder includes a text file with detailed instructions on what files are needed, where to place them, and how to set them up. Please refer to those files for proper configuration.

3. Install dependencies:
    Make sure all required packages are installed:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Update database configuration:
    Modify the database credentials in the following files:
        app/main.py ‚Üí Line 60
            Locate the connection string:
                mysql://username:password@host:port/fashion

            Replace username, password, host, and port with your actual MySQL credentials.
            
            Do not change the database name (fashion) ‚Äî it will be created automatically by the program.

        app/database.py ‚Üí Line 4
            Update the constructor parameters in the __init__ method:
                def __init__(self, host='localhost', user='your_username', password='your_password', database='fashion'):

            Replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your actual MySQL username and password.

5. Set up Gemini API (Custom Search)
    This project uses the Gemini Custom Search API. You'll need two credentials:
        G_API_KEY: Your Gemini API key
        G_CX: Your Custom Search Engine ID (CX)
    
    üìç Where to use them:
    In app/main.py ‚Üí Line 40, the API key is accessed like this:
        API_KEY = os.getenv('G_API_KEY')  # Recommended for security

    While you can hardcode the key (e.g., API_KEY = "your_api_key"), using environment variables is strongly recommended for better security.

    ‚úÖ How to set environment variables from the command line:

    On Windows (Command Prompt):
        set G_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key"
        set G_CX = "your_actual_cx_value"

    On macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):
        export G_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
        export G_CX=your_actual_cx_value

    These variables will be available during the session and accessed in your code via os.getenv().

6. Set Up Hugging Face API for Virtual Try-On

    This project uses Hugging Face‚Äôs Inference API to generate virtual try-on clothing images.

    üîó https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

    To avoid failures due to rate limits, you can use multiple API keys (e.g., from different accounts).

    In ai_engine/virtual_try_on.py ‚Üí Line 10, update the api_tokens list:

        Option 1 (Direct):
            api_tokens = ["your_api_key_1", "your_api_key_2"]

        Option 2 (Using environment variables ‚Äì recommended):
            Set in terminal:
                set HF_ONE_API = "Your API KEY"
                set HF_TWO_API = "Your API KEY"

            Update code:
                api_tokens = [os.getenv("HF_ONE_API"), os.getenv("HF_TWO_API")]
            
        One key is enough to start, but multiple keys improve reliability.

7. Set Up Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)

    This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to detect the current weather based on your location.

    üîó https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

    In the file app/main.py, update the following lines:
        Line 104
        Line 127
    Replace:
        OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY = ""  # Replace with your API key
    With:
        OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY = "your_api_key"

    This API is used to detect the user's current weather conditions, which helps personalize outfit recommendations.

    ‚úÖ Only one API key is needed.

8. Run the Project
    Once all setup steps are complete, start the application by running:
        python run.py

    The application will start locally and provide two links:
        A local URL (accessible only from your machine)
        An external URL (via NGROK, accessible from any device connected to the internet)
    
    üåê Make Your App Public with NGROK
    To allow others to access your app online, you can use NGROK ‚Äî a tunneling service that exposes your local server to the internet.

    üîó Download NGROK https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows
    
    üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions:
        1. Move the downloaded NGROK executable to a convenient location (e.g., C:\ngrok or inside your project directory).

        2. Open NGROK in a terminal (double-click or use command line).

        3. Run the following command (replace 5000 with your actual port if different):
            ngrok http 5000 
        4. NGROK will generate a public URL (e.g., https://your-app.ngrok.io).
            Share this link ‚Äî anyone can visit your application from anywhere.

    üîí Optional: Set a Static Domain
        To keep your NGROK URL unchanged in the future:
        Visit the "Deploy Your App" section on NGROK's dashboard.
        Set up a static domain for consistent access.

9. Stop the Project
    To terminate the running application, press:
        Ctrl + C
    This will stop the server and end the process.
